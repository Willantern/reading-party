# 原文：研究背景
<!-- <div class="overflow-hidden">
Despite wearable self-tracking devices' potential to improve their users' health, they do not live up to that potential when users discontinue using them after short periods or use them in ineffective ways. To yield positive health effects, wearables must not only be used but also used effectively, that is, in a way that helps achieve the goals for using them.

# 有效使用理论

**有效使用**："以有助于实现系统使用目标的方式使用系统" (Burton-Jones & Grange, 2013)

三个维度：
- 透明交互：无障碍访问系统表征
- 表征保真度：系统表征忠实反映被表征领域
- 知情行动：基于忠实表征采取行动改善状态

# 原文：有效使用定义

**"Effective use as 'using a system in a way that helps attain the goals for using the system'"** (Page 3)

**Three Dimensions:**
- **"Transparent interaction** refers to 'the extent to which a user is accessing the system's representations unimpeded by its surface and physical structures'"
- **"Representational fidelity** refers to 'the extent to which a user is obtaining representations from the system that faithfully reflect the domain being represented'"
- **"Informed action** refers to 'the extent to which a user acts upon the faithful representations he or she obtains from the system to improve his or her state'"** (Page 4)

# 应对理论

**应对**：人们为处理压力情境而采取的思想和行为 (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004)

应对过程：
1. 遭遇压力情境
2. 认知评估
3. 应对处理
4. 结果评估

IS文献主要关注前两步，较少关注**应对结果**

# 原文：应对理论

**"Coping refers to the thoughts and behaviors people employ to manage stressful situations (Folkman and Moskowitz 2004). At the start of all coping processes stand individuals who encounter stressful situations (Lazarus 1993) and then undertake cognitive appraisals to determine what the situation means for them personally... Then they deal with the situation (cope) in a way that is intended to reduce the initial stress... Finally, they evaluate the outcomes of the coping process"** (Page 4)

**"The vast information systems (IS) literature on coping... focuses on how users appraise stressful situations when they use IS... and how they choose to cope... but gives limited attention to the outcomes of coping"** (Page 2)

**Decomposition:** *"identifying and extracting from a complex event its basic components—agents, conditions, and events"* (Page 7)

**Theoretical Redescription:** *"reconstruct the component events into sequential patterns that are suited to theorizing... the component events were brought into the order of the coping process—the stressful encounter, the invoked emotional state, and ways of coping"* (Page 8)

**Retroduction:** *"abstract and analyze phenomena in terms of the structures and causal powers that give rise to them"* (Page 9)

# 应对模式与有效使用

**改善有效使用的应对方式**：
- 参与请求的行为
- 改变使用相关行为
- 适应系统结构

**无明显影响的应对方式**：
- 合理化
- 重新解释信息
- 寻求社会支持

**损害有效使用的应对方式**：

# 原文：应对模式影响

**"The study's findings indicate that, although some ways of coping, such as engaging in the requested behaviors, improved effective use, others, such as adapting the system or venting, had no considerable effects, whereas still others, such as cheating, hampered effective use."** (Page 1)

**"Some of the users coped in ways that improved their effective use of wearables... some coped in ways that did not considerably affect effective use... and some coped in ways that reduced effective use"** (Page 2)

# 情境条件的影响

**能动性结构**：
- 能动性一致 vs 能动性冲突
- 冲突导致适应不良的应对模式

**结构性障碍**：
- 用户限制（动机、能力）
- 系统约束（属性、能力）
- 障碍促使选择适应不良的应对方式

---
layout: quote
---

# 原文：情境条件

**"Two contextual conditions, agency structure and structural barriers, explain users' selection of (mal)adaptive coping patterns under different generative mechanisms."** (Page 1)

**Agency Structure:** *"can manifest as agency alignment or agency conflict, that is, when users' expectations about the agentic position of wearables and the actual agentic position of wearables are in line or diverge, respectively"* (Page 10)

**Structural Barriers:** *"stem from either user limitations (e.g., motivation, incapacity) or system constraints (e.g., properties, capabilities) that impede users' ability to adjust"* (Page 10)

# 原文：对有效使用理论的贡献

**"First, it contributes to the theory of effective use by highlighting the dual nature of agency, as well as the dynamics and theoretical scope in the effective use of wearables."** (Page 2)

**"This study suggests that negative incidents and coping can act as turning points in effective use... this study highlights human behavior (i.e., coping) as a central source of adverse effects on effective use."** (Page 19)

**"Scholarship may benefit from expanding the boundaries of the theory of effective use from a singular IS perspective to a multisystem perspective"** (Page 19)

# 对IS应对文献的贡献

1. **识别新的负面事件类别**：能动性冲突
   - 强制目标
   - 缺失或不适当的指导

2. **发现新的应对方式**：
   - 改变使用相关行为
   - 为长期行为改变做准备
   - 欺骗和操纵信息（自我欺骗）

# 原文：对IS应对文献的贡献

**"Second, the study contributes to the IS coping literature, as it theorizes agency conflicts as a new class of negative incidents."** (Page 2)

**"Second, the study expands the IS coping literature by identifying new ways of coping... Changing use-related behaviors... Setting up for long-term behavioral change... cheating and manipulating information"** (Page 20)

**"The IS literature does not identify the coping categories of planning, turning to religion, or alcohol-drug disengagement, but it identifies three ways of coping that do not correspond with any of the categories of the COPE inventory"** (Page 5)

# 对可穿戴设备研究的贡献

1. **解释有限成功原因**：
   - 适应不良的应对方式直接或间接损害有效使用
   - 阐明无效使用模式和 attrition

2. **阐明理论独特性**：
   - 作为接近人体的能动系统
   - 说服性需结合人类代理、任务和生成机制

# 原文：对可穿戴设备研究的贡献

**"Third, the study contributes to wearable-specific research by offering an explanation for flawed use patterns... Therefore, the ways that users cope helps to explain wearables' limited success in promoting health behaviors."** (Page 2)

**"The distinct coping patterns caused by four generative mechanisms show that wearable use's agency structures and degrees of technology agency vary. Therefore, although wearables have persuasive features..., this study's findings indicate that persuasiveness is more than a material system property, as it must be viewed in relation to the human agent"** (Page 22)

# 原文：实践意义

**"IS practice should rethink how it monitors system use, as making it an integrative part of users' routines and workflows and communicating and reinforcing the goals that using IS can achieve are key to effective use."** (Page 22)

**"The two main classes of negative incidents found in this study are issues with data accuracy and completeness and issues with agency conflicts, both of which can be avoided or their impact mitigated through design."** (Page 22)

**"Because foreseeing the occurrence of agency conflicts is difficult, providers of wearables are advised to review users' expectations regarding agency (e.g., through questionnaires) and to leverage usage histories and interaction patterns so the wearable can adjust to differences between expected and actual agency structures."** (Page 22)

**"The analysis yielded four generative mechanisms—self-control, confirmation, progress, and datafication—that give rise to distinct coping patterns and affect effective use. Two contextual conditions, agency structure and structural barriers, explain users' selection of (mal)adaptive coping patterns under different generative mechanisms."** (Page 1)
